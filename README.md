# Iris
This is very quick and simple demonstration of using the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for determining the species of Iris based on specific features. The ML model is based on the Scikit learn Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm. The Iris data set is sourced from teh seaborn library. The dataset contains five columns: a set of four featurs and a fifth column identifying the species.

There are just 150 entries. These are split into a Test and training data set.
